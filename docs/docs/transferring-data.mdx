title: Transferring data between Actions
---

As an action can be composed with others, a good feature that exists is the ability to take some output from one action and use it in the workflow and other actions within a job.

## Defining outputs

an output can be done by using the '::set-output' command.

Usage in shell:

```shell
echo '::set-output name=uploaded::true'
```

Usage in Actions Toolkit

```js
const core = require("@actions/core")

core.setOutput("uploaded", "true")
```

the name will be a string that you define in the [action.yml](/docs/action-yml) file under the `outputs` field.

## Example workflow

Let's say we have an action that does some processing on data and then tries uploading some data. If the upload is success, we will define an output variable `file_uploaded` to be set to the string `true`

Let's define this output in the action.yml file:

```yml
name: Data processor
outputs:
  file_uploaded:
    description: field that will set whether a file was uploaded.
```

Now if we want to use it in the workflow, we can do such by accessing it from the step's context. do note you need to give a step an id if you wish to access outputs out of it.

```yml
# ...

steps:
  - uses: my-cool-action
    id: cool_action
  - name: Do only if cool_action uploaded data
    if: steps.cool_action.outputs.file_uploaded == 'true'
    run: echo "stuff was uploaded"
```

or you could also use it as an input to another action.

```yml
- uses: another_action
  with:
    was_file_uploaded: ${{ steps.cool_action.outputs.file_uploaded }}
```
