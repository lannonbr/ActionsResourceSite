title: Docker Actions
---

Alongside running code on the bare VM or bundled in a [JS Action](/docs/js-actions/), you can also package up code & scripts into a docker container. This provides access to run any tool and then bundle it up to be used quickly in a worflow using a `uses` step.

## Setting up a image

The only two needed instructions in the dockerfile for a Docker action is the `FROM` and `ENTRYPOINT` saying what the base image should be and what should run.

As well, files can be brought into the container with a `COPY` instruction. A Dockerfile as such could look like the following:

```dockerfile title=Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:18.04

COPY entrypoint.sh /entrypoint

ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
```

An entrypoint shell script is a good way to say what code should be run when the docker container is executed.

```bash title=entrypoint.sh
#!/bin/bash

echo 'Running from a container!'
```

The script has to have the executable bit turned on so be sure to run this command before commiting it:

```bash
chmod +x entrypoint.sh
```

**Notice**: It is not required to build a docker image but can improve performance by building them. More details later.

## Action.yml for a docker container.

The [action.yml](/docs/action-yml/) only differs slightly compared to writing a JS Action. Inside it, the `using` key will say `docker` as the runtime and then the `image` key will point to a relative filepath for where the Dockerfile exists.

```yml title=action.yml
name: My cool docker action
description: a new GitHub Action doing things in a docker container
runs:
  using: "docker"
  image: "Dockerfile"
```

If you built the dockerfile into an image, you can as well pass in a URI to it from any registry.

For instance, if the image is on [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/features/packages), then it would be:

```yml title=action.yml
runs:
  using: "docker"
  image: "docker://docker.pkg.github.com/user/repo/my-image:1.0.0"
```

Building the container into an image will reduce workflow run times so this is reccomended if the container takes a bit to build or is used frequently.

Once this is all set, the docker action can be [published up to the GitHub Marketplace](/docs/publish-actions/).

## Access to the host filesystem

In every container, The `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` environment variable will point to the workspace of the job.

So say we ran a Python script that saves a file `data.json` in the `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` folder. After this container is done being run and cleaned, the same folder in the host system will still include that file.
