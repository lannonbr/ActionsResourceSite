title: Repository Dispatch
---

If you wish to trigger a workflow externally, the `repository_dispatch` event is the one to look into.

Here's an example workflow which uses this trigger and will echo 'Hello!' when you send a request to it with the `event_type` of test

```yaml title=workflow.yml
name: Dispatch action
on: repository_dispatch
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Say hello on 'test' event
        if: github.event.action == 'test'
        run: |
          echo 'Hello!'
```

Then, you can send a POST request to the API as follows:

```shell title=exec.sh
curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
    -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github.everest-preview+json' \
    "https://api.github.com/repos/username/MyRepo/dispatches" \
    -d '{"event_type": "test"}'
```

you need to use a Personal Access Token for authorization purposes. as well, you need to put a `event_type` in the body of the POST. this event type matches up to `github.event.action` in the GitHub context available to your workflow.

As well, if you wish to add a payload, the POST can also take `client_payload` which is an object which then will be available at `github.event.client_payload` on the Actions side.
