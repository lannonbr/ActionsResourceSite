There are limits to what you can do with Actions dependent on your plan.

## Private Repo limits

On public repos, GitHub Actions workflow runs will always be free, but there is a pay-as-you-go system for private repos.

Each GitHub plan gives you a certain amount of minutes for free per month

| type       | minutes |
| ---------- | ------- |
| Free       | 2,000   |
| Pro        | 3,000   |
| Team       | 10,000  |
| Enterprise | 50,000  |

After such, you have to start paying for additional minutes depending on the OS you use

| OS      | cost / minute |
| ------- | ------------- |
| Linux   | \$0.008       |
| Windows | \$0.016       |
| MacOS   | \$0.08        |

On top of such, In late 2019, you can run the GitHub Actions runner on your own machines free of charge.

## Concurrency limits

- 20 concurrent workflows can run per repo
- 1000 API requests per hour can be made per repo
- Individual jobs can run for a max of 6 hours.
- The amount of concurrent jobs run across a single account depends on your plan

| Plan       | Total concurrent jobs |
| ---------- | --------------------- |
| Free       | 20                    |
| Pro        | 40                    |
| Team       | 60                    |
| Enterprise | 180                   |
