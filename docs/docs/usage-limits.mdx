title: Usage Limits
---

There are limits to what you can do with Actions dependent on your plan.

## Private Repo Limits

On public repos, GitHub Actions workflow runs will always be free, but there is a pay-as-you-go system for private repos.

Each GitHub plan gives you a certain amount of minutes for free per month.

| Plan       | Minutes |
| ---------- | ------- |
| Free       | 2,000   |
| Pro        | 3,000   |
| Team       | 10,000  |
| Enterprise | 50,000  |

### Billing Calculations

As well, each OS will calculate billed usage time differently:

| OS      | Usage Time (in minutes) | Billed Time (in minutes) |
| ------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Linux   | 1                       | 1                        |
| Windows | 1                       | 2                        |
| MacOS   | 1                       | 10                       |

So for example, if you ran 30 minutes on a MacOS hosted runner for a private repo, it would show up as 300 minutes in the billing dashboard.

### Additional usage costs

After such, you have to start paying for additional minutes depending on the OS you use.

| OS      | Cost / minute |
| ------- | ------------- |
| Linux   | \$0.008       |
| Windows | \$0.016       |
| MacOS   | \$0.08        |

On top of such, you can run the GitHub Actions runner on your own machines free of charge.

## Concurrency Limits

Jobs and workflows will run concurrently by default, but there are some limitations on how much can run at the same time on your repo.

- 20 concurrent workflows can run per repo
- 1000 API requests per hour can be made per repo
- Individual jobs can run for a max of 6 hours.
- The amount of concurrent jobs run across a single account depends on your plan

| Plan       | Total concurrent jobs |
| ---------- | --------------------- |
| Free       | 20                    |
| Pro        | 40                    |
| Team       | 60                    |
| Enterprise | 180                   |

> Note: You can only run 5 jobs on hosted MacOS runners at a time (15 on Enterprise accounts)
