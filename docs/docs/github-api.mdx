title: GitHub API Access
---

Working with GitHub APIs is a powerful tool in GitHub Actions. There are a variety of methods of accessing GitHub's APIs depending on the language you wish to use.

## GITHUB_TOKEN

In all workflows, there is a default secret called `GITHUB_TOKEN` which provides a personal access token Read/Write access to many APIs on the specific repo.

It can be inserted anywhere in a workflow in the `env` key at the workflow, job, or step level. For example at the job level:

```yml title=main.yml
jobs:
  run:
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    steps:
      # now able to use GITHUB_TOKEN
```

> Note: If you need API access outside the current repo, you'll need to create a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)

## Javascript: @actions/github

As part of the [Actions Toolkit](https://github.com/actions/toolkit), a wrapper around the JS Octokit client is available.

To use it, download the `@actions/github` node module.

```bash
yarn add @actions/github
```

Then for instance, imagine you are running a workflow on a new issue, you could create a comment on it.

```js title=make-comment.js
const github = require("@actions/github")

// Access token provided by GitHub in all actions
const token = process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN

// GitHub event payload
const context = github.context

// Create a
const octokit = new github.GitHub(token)

// Example: create a comment on an issue
octokit.issues.createComment({
  ...context.issue,
  body: "Thanks for submitting an issue! We will get to it shortly",
})
```
