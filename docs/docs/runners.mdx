title: Runners
---

GitHub Actions by default will run on hosted VMs by GitHub. You can run your workflows on Windows, MacOS, and Linux. On the Linux VMs, you also can run Docker.

## Machine Specs

The VMs are `Standard_DS2_v2` virtual machines on Microsoft Azure for the Windows and Linux VMs while the MacOS VMs are run on [MacStadium](https://www.macstadium.com/). Each machine gives you the following:

- 7GB of RAM
- 2 CPU cores
- 14GB of SSD space

To use these runners, each platform can be done in a job using the `runs-on` key with a label that matches the OS and version you wish:

| Virtual environment    | runs-on value                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Windows Server 2019    | `windows-latest`                  |
| Ubuntu 18.04           | `ubuntu-latest` or `ubuntu-18.04` |
| Ubuntu 16.04           | `ubuntu-16.04`                    |
| macOS X Catalina 10.15 | `macos-latest`                    |
